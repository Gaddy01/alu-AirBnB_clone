The AirBnB clone is a web development project that involves creating a static website that mimics the functionality of the AirBnB website. The project is divided into several phases, and the first phase is to create the static pages of the website.

The static pages of the website are the pages that do not require any dynamic content, such as user input or data from a database. The static pages of the AirBnB website include the homepage, the listings page, the contact page, and the about page.

To create the static pages of the AirBnB website, you will need to use HTML and CSS. HTML is the markup language that is used to create the structure of a web page, and CSS is the style sheet language that is used to control the appearance of a web page.

Once you have created the static pages of the AirBnB website, you will need to deploy them to a web server. A web server is a computer that is used to store and deliver web pages to users. There are many different web servers available, such as Apache, Nginx, and IIS.

Once you have deployed the static pages of the AirBnB website to a web server, you will be able to view them in a web browser.

Here are some of the things you will need to do to create the static pages of the AirBnB clone:

Create a new HTML file for each page.
Add the appropriate HTML markup to each page.
Add the appropriate CSS styles to each page.
Deploy the pages to a web server.
